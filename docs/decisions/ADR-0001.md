# ADR-0001 — Tech Stack Selection

## Context
ShayrdAir needed a lean stack to ship an MVP fast with strong AI assist capability and minimal ops overhead.

## Decision
Adopt Webflow (UX/UI) + Wized (logic) + Supabase (backend & auth) + Stripe (payments), deployed via Vercel.

## Rationale
- Webflow enables no-code UI iteration and export to Git-tracked HTML/CSS.
- Wized provides front-end logic binding without custom React code.
- Supabase offers Postgres, Row-Level Security, and triggers with minimal setup.
- Stripe is trusted for marketplaces and has mature webhook support.
- Vercel integrates directly with GitHub for preview deploys and CI.

## Consequences
- Custom backend logic limited to SQL triggers and Supabase functions.
- Migration to a React/Next stack is possible later without vendor lock-in.
- AI systems can reason about stack layers using these files as ground truth.
